    "Training and evaluating deep neural networks is a computationally intensive task. For modestly sized problems and datasets it may be possible to train your network on the CPU in your local machine, but it could take anywhere from 15 minutes to several hours depending on the number of epochs, the size of the neural networks, and other factors. A faster alternative is to train on a GPU, which is a type of processor that supports greater parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not already have a computer with a built-in NVIDIA GPU, we suggest you use an `Amazon EC2` instance. There are many cloud service providers that offer equivalent functionality, but EC2 is a reasonable default that is available to most students. In the next few sections, we'll go over the steps from nothing to running a neural network on an Amazon server."

    "\n",
    "By default, AWS sets a limit of 0 on the number of p2.xlarge instances a user can run, which effectively prevents you from launching this instance. If your limit of p2.xlarge instances is 0, you'll need to increase the limit before you can launch an instance. From the EC2 Service Limits page, click on “Request limit increase” next to “p2.xlarge”. You will not be charged for requesting a limit increase. You will only be charged once you actually launch an instance."
